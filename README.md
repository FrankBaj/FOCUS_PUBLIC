# FOCUS
- This repository contains all of the files for the class project for my 4HC3 Human Computer Interfaces course.

# Project Contributers:
- Francis Bajamunde (This was a solo-project)

# Description
- The purpose of this project was to put into practice the User Experience Design and User Interface Design concepts learned during the course.
- This project involved the creation of a website using HTML, CSS, and React.js

# What I learned:
- How to go through the User Experience Design process.
- How to take a project from conceptualization, to wireframes, to a design document, to implementation through code, and lastly through usability testing.
- How to create a website using HTML, CSS, and React.js

# NOTE:
The project was hosted using Heroku, however the project is no longer online. If you are interested in seeing a demonstration of the application, I have a short recording of myself going through the website's features. Contact me if you wish to see it.
